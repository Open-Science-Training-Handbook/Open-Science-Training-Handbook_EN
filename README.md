## The Open Science Training Handbook

A group of fourteen authors came together in February 2018 at the TIB \(German National Library of Science and Technology\) in Hannover to create an open, living handbook on Open Science training. High-quality trainings are fundamental when aiming at a cultural change towards the implementation of Open Science principles. Teaching resources provide great support for Open Science instructors and trainers. The Open Science training handbook will be a key resource and a first step towards developing Open Access and Open Science curricula and andragogies. Supporting and connecting an emerging Open Science community that wishes to pass on their knowledge as multipliers, the handbook will enrich training activities and unlock the community’s full potential.

Sharing their experience and skills of imparting Open Science principles, the authors \(see [below](#the-authors-and-the-book-sprint-facilitators)\) produced an open knowledge and educational resource oriented to practical teaching. The focus of the new handbook is not spreading the ideas of Open Science, but showing **how** to spread these ideas most effectively. The form of a book sprint as a collaborative writing process maximized creativity and innovation, and ensured the production of a valuable resource in just a few days.

Bringing together methods, techniques, and practices, the handbook aims at supporting educators of Open Science. The result is intended as a helpful guide on how to forward knowledge on Open Science principles to our networks, institutions, colleagues, and students. It will instruct and inspire trainers how to create high quality and engaging trainings. Addressing challenges and giving solutions, it will strengthen the community of Open Science trainers who are educating, informing, and inspiring themselves.

## Help us making the handbook better

We welcome comments and feedback from everyone, irrespective of their expertise or background. The easiest way to do this is to use [hypothes.is](https://via.hypothes.is/https://book.fosteropenscience.eu). Also, you can create pull requests, either from within the Gitbook website or app, or with any tool you like. The handbook's content is maintained as [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/Open-Science-Training-Handbook).

## How to refer to the handbook

Please consider citing the handbook when using the content. To cite the book, we recommend that you either refer to 

* https://book.fosteropenscience.eu/, which is the most friendly way to read the book (also available as [PDF](https://book.fosteropenscience.eu/en/book.pdf) and [ePub](https://book.fosteropenscience.eu/en/book.epub)), to comment and to suggest changes, _or_ 

* https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1212496, which is a citable DOI refering to a (hardly comprehensible) archived dump of the book.
