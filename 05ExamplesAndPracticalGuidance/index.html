<h3 id="examples--practical-guidance-adopt-adapt-develop">Examples &amp; Practical Guidance: adopt, adapt, develop</h3>
<p>In this chapter, you will find a wealth of materials to help you actively engage your trainees in critically examining Open Science issues.</p>
<p>We recommend you approach all of these materials with the motto &quot;Adopt, adapt, develop&quot; in mind&#x2014;meaning that its best to re-use what exists where possible. Hence, before you start developing training resources from scratch you should find out whether there are existing resources you may use. We give some example resources here, with tips for how they could be adapted for your purposes. We also provide links and strategies to help you find further material. In some cases, existing resources may be used as they are, so you may simply <strong>adopt</strong> them. An example at stake may be an openly available video tutorial about open file formats which you may point your audience to. In other cases, you may have to <strong>adapt</strong> existing resources somewhat in order to make them fit your purposes. For example, you may need to add/replace some institution- or country-specific references to an existing overview of Open Access requirements issued by research funders. Only as a last resort you should <strong>develop</strong> your own training resources from scratch. If you want to develop your own training materials, be sure to develop Open Educational Resources so that other trainers can reuse and adapt your materials.</p>

<p><strong>Open Science G&#xF6;ttingen Meet-ups </strong>at the University Library at Uni G&#xF6;ttingen<strong> (3 hours)</strong></p>
<p>The Open Science Network G&#xF6;ttingen, a group of researchers and librarians who support open science practices and knowledge exchange regularly organize these meet-up events where various open science related topics are discussed. The network unites people interested in Open Science topics at the G&#xF6;ttingen Campus and is open to everyone. They have become quite popular attracting scholars from different disciplines who are eager to discuss their experiences with open scholarship and to learn about new methods, tools, and practices. Invited speakers usually introduce the topics which is followed by small group discussions with a more in-depth view on related issues. </p>

<p><strong>Mozilla Study groups (a series of 2&#x2013;3 hour meetings)</strong></p>
<p>Study groups are communities of peers (e.g., from the same institution) committed to learning and teaching each other. They&#x2019;re fun, informal meetups allowing participants to share skills, experiences, and ideas around open science, open source, code, and community in research. The goal of the <a href="https://science.mozilla.org/programs/studygroups" target="_blank">Mozilla Study Group Project</a> is to support this kind of peer-to-peer study by providing a simple set of tools, template lesson plans, and access to an international community of like-minded researchers and avid learners in code

<p><strong>Reproducible analysis and Research Transparency (a single full-day workshop)</strong></p>
<p>Transparency, open sharing, and reproducibility are core values of science, but not always part of daily practice. A first iteration of this workshop took place within the context of the <a href="https://nioo.knaw.nl/en/open-science-tools" target="_blank">Open Science Tools, Data &amp; Technologies for Efficient Ecological &amp; Evolutionary Research</a> event, organized by NIOO-KNAW and DANS-KNAW. It provides an overview of current status in reproducible analysis in order to provide transparency in research. The workshop covers methodological topics (such as the use of the Open Science Framework and reporting guidelines) as well as software tools (such as Git, Docker, RMarkdown / knitr, and Jupyter). Going beyond simple listing and presentations, the second half of the workshop focuses on hands-on skill building, with exercises and tutorials covering most of the software aspects. Material and content is available here: <a href="http://reproducible-analysis-workshop.readthedocs.io" target="_blank">reproducible-analysis-workshop.readthedocs.io</a></p>
<p><strong>Open Science: what&#x2019;s in it for me? (1-2 days)</strong></p>
<p>The aim of the workshop is to provide researchers and administrators with hands-on examples of Open Science tools and workflow examples across various disciplines, and to start applying and discussing these. For this, we present an overview of Open Science practices and tools that are used throughout the scientific workflow, with practical examples, audience polling and interactive discussions. The second day is oriented at application and sharing. In various rounds participants explore and where possible try out or apply tools and practices. They do this in small groups and individually and also in a lively marketplace. In a final session we have a discussion on obstacles and incentives for switching to open science in your own research.</p>

<p><strong>Carpentry workshops (2 days)</strong></p>
<p>A Carpentry workshop is a hands-on two-day event that covers the core skills needed to be productive in a small research team. Short tutorials alternate with practical exercises, and all instruction is done via live coding. Software Carpentry was founded in 1998 and Data Carpentry was founded in 2013. Both focus on computational skills, run two-day workshops taught by volunteer instructors, and strive to fill gaps in current training for researchers. However, they differ in their content and intended audience. Data Carpentry workshops focus on best practices surrounding data. Its learners are not people who want to learn about coding, but rather those who have a lot of data and don&#x2019;t know what to do with it. Data Carpentry workshops are aimed at pure novices, are domain-specific, and present a full curriculum centered around a single data set. Software Carpentry workshops are intended for people who need to program more effectively to solve their computational challenges, are not domain-specific, and are modular&#x2014;each Software Carpentry lesson is standalone.</p>

<p><strong>EIFL Train-the-Trainer program (4 days)</strong></p>
<p>EIFL organized a train-the-trainers program for five universities in EIFL partner countries (Ethiopia, Ghana, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, and Nepal) that have committed to integrating open access, open science and open research data into courses for PhD students. Day 1 covered open access and open data. Day 2 and 3 were dedicated to open science across the research workflow, including current practices at participant&#x2019;s universities. On Day 4, participants designed and prepared their own training program. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>&quot;Working in an Open Science manner makes research more fun&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;Scooping is a real and existing problem that makes Open Science a hard choice&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;APCs (article processing charges) are the main obstacle to publishing more in Open Access&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;We need more explicit support for Open Science from funders and the  government&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;Engaging in open peer review is problematic for young researchers that want to make a career&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;We should take citizen scientists more seriously, and also not just see them as data suppliers&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;Impact factors are a symptom and not the cause of the publishing rat-race&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;There is absolutely no reason we should not publish a paper as a preprint as soon as it is ready&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;Just sharing our data is fine, but to speed up science we need to also work on interoperability and reusability of those data&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;Sharing ideas and projects through ResearchGate is a good way of doing outreach for our research&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;Demands of our PIs are probably the main reason why young researchers do not engage more in Open Science&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;We should strive to create a kind of &#x2018;commons&#x2019; where we share all our research outcomes/objects to foster collaboration and reuse&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The set-up: 6-8 people gather around a table with 1 moderator and 1 note taker. To initiate conversations, they are provided with a deck of cards with statements and questions related to open science and the involved projects. These statements  serve as conversation starters. Someone can pick a card, the group talks about it for some time, and then they can move on to the next card. In this way, people learn from each other and start to think about the bigger picture. Meanwhile, you can collect valuable input from different stakeholders.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The note taker: collects interesting points of the conversation in two different ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The mindmap cards: You can use these cards for topics that get a lot of attention in the conversation. If things go too fast, don&#x2019;t be afraid to stop the conversation and ask people to provide input for this mindmap. Write down the main topic in the centre, and work from there.

<li><p>This exercise is meant for any researchers that will use software/code for their research, whether they perform purely computational or experimental work (the latter use software for analysis, etc.). </p>
</li>
<li><p>First, have everyone sign up for a free <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub account</a> if they do not already have one. This free account will be sufficient for working with exclusively open/public code, although you may let them know that students, educators, and researchers can <a href="https://education.github.com/" target="_blank">request a waiver for a free professional account</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In addition, have participants register for a <a href="https://zenodo.org/" target="_blank">Zenodo account</a>, and link this to their GitHub account.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Next, have everyone create a new public repository, choosing an appropriate license based on the desired permissions (choosealicense.org can be helpful here). On Zenodo, enable the <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/" target="_blank">GitHub&#x2013;Zenodo integration</a> for this repository.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Have participants add their source file(s) to the repository, and add some description of the program/script to the README file. Once these files are added, choose a version number and <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/" target="_blank">create a release</a> of the software.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Head to Zenodo, and obtain the DOI that has been generated for your software. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Congratulations, your software is now citeable! You can add a section to the README file with the DOI and suggested citation, or even add the DOI badge that Zenodo provides.</p>

<li><p>Exercise description</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Each participant selects a dataset and corresponding data analysis process that is relevant to their field. Both dataset and the analysis process should be short enough that it concludes within a few minutes. Moreover, for the purposes of this exercise, the programming language should be Python or R, but other languages can be accommodated with slight changes in the underlying tools.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The participant initially runs the process in the traditional form, and then asks one of the other participants to re-run it with no external help. Identify both the time required for another person to run this, as well as the obstacles encountered.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Apply the same process using the Jupyter / Git / MyBinder approach; write the process as a Jupyter notebook, upload dataset and notebook to a repository on GitHub, and then connect the repository to mybinder. After than, ask again the same person to re-run this. Identify the change in time and accessibility.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Materials and tools needed</p>
<ul>
<li>Jupyter and Git are necessary (including an account on GitHub). Depending on the language, additional Jupyter kernels might need to be installed. Finally, the trainer can decide on whether to provide a common example for all participants to use, or ask the participants to bring their own.

<li><p>Level of prior knowledge needed</p>
<ul>
<li>The workshop can be performed to different levels of expected prior knowledge, adapting for time. For example, a short basic introduction to Git can be included, but in all cases, the participants should be aware of the computational requirements of their own analysis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Things to bear in mind</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The overall concept is straightforward, but has an initial learning curve of the individual components. Therefore you may consider spending some extra time in the beginning discussing each tool, before connecting them all together.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You should consider giving the participants a detailed explanation of the installation process (e.g., for Jupyter and Git), before the workshop, in order to minimize potential technical issues.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>How to adapt for other purposes</p>
<ul>
<li>The workshop can be extended to introduce additional concepts of Open Science, such as Persistent Identifiers for software (such as assigning a DOI from Zenodo to the Git repo), as well as integrating all of the aspects under a common platform (such as the OSF).</li>

</li>
<li><p>Exercise description</p>
<ul>
<li>Participants work in groups of three. Each participants writes a short text (~300 words) giving their thoughts on open peer review as discussed in the foregoing workshop. They then pass the text to the person on their left, who writes a brief peer review of the work. The text and the review are then passed to the next person on the left, so each now has a text and a review which they did not write. This person then gives feedback on the review&#x2014;was it constructive, critical, what could have been better, etc. The group then reads all the texts and reflects on how open identities, open reports, etc. affected how they wrote their reviews, and reflects on the critical feedback from the others.</li>

</li>
<li><p>Things to bear in mind</p>
<ul>
<li>This exercise requires participants to make criticisms of each other&#x2019;s work&#x2014;bear in mind that some people might be uncomfortable doing so, or that some may have difficulty accepting such critique. Where these issues occur, encourage participants to discuss them in the final discussion round.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>How to adapt for other purposes</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Where this example is being used in a training workshop with a wider focus than just open peer review, it could be used to consolidate learning about other Open Science themes by asking participants to first write a text about those themes instead.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Instead of pen and paper, this exercise could also be done using a collaborative writing tool, such as Google Docs, Authorea, or Overleaf/ShareLaTeX. </p>

</li>
<li><p>Things to bear in mind</p>
<ul>
<li>If done on paper, it might make sense to have people mark down their answer  individually first, before placing their dot on the map. This prevents peer pressure / bias.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>How to adapt for other purposes</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This exercise can be adapted to many different questions and topics</p>
</li>
<li><p>An alternative online tool (that is also open source) for these kind of exercises is SimpleVote (<a href="https://simplevote.ml" target="_blank">https://simplevote.ml</a>)</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the audience is heterogeneous (i.e., researchers, research support people, policy makers) it is informative to distinguish between the different groups, e.g., by creating a separate question for each (in Mentimeter), or using different color sticky dots (on paper)</p>

<li>Trainers can use this game to facilitate &#x2018;train-the-trainer&#x2019; workshops. Participants design a usable framework for a training &#x2013; which will they deliver themselves at a later stage -  on (a) topic(s) of their choice. The card game offers the participants the option to preselect audience type, audience size, training type and audience knowledge level. In addition, two &#x2018;unforeseen&#x2019; circumstances can be added: audience mood, and &#x2018;trouble&#x2019; (uh-oh!).

</li>
<li><p>Exercise description</p>
<ul>
<li>INSTRUCTIONS: <ul>
<li>Have each group pick a card (blind) determining: audience type, audience size, audience knowledge level and training type. It is possible that the different cards turn out a training situation that is impossible or that is not in line with to the interests of the group. It can be useful to allow some flexibility and allow people to change cards or switch cards with another group. In most cases, there is an empty card or an &#x2018;other&#x2019; card available as well, allowing people to modify the exercise according to their own needs. </li>
<li>Hand out the persona pages: every member of the group should create one persona according to the conditions laid out on the cards (no longer than 15 mins). </li>
<li>The group has 1,5 hour to prepare the training according to the conditions laid out by the cards, keeping in mind their target audience(s), with help of the persona pages created. </li>
<li>Have each group present their training (take note: they don&#x2019;t have to give the actual training, they only have to describe what they will do!) . Ask the other groups to give feedback afterwards: Is the proposed training suitable for the conditions laid out by the cards? What would they do differently? Do they have any experiences that they can share?</li>
<li>Extra challenge: How would each group deal with unexpected/unpredictable circumstances during the training? Right before their presentation, each group picks (blind) an &apos;audience mood&apos; card and a &apos;trouble&apos; card and gives them to the moderator, who will either during the presentation or afterwards discuss these cards with the entire group &#x2013; allowing the audience to learn from the experience of their colleagues.</li>

<h4 id="what-tools--platforms-to-use--recommend">What tools &amp; platforms to use / recommend?</h4>
<p>There are many tools and platforms that support Open Science practices (see figure below for a selection). Which tools and platforms to use (or advise) depends on many factors, for example: whether the tool is available (either free of at low cost or licensed to your institution), whether it works in your browser or for your operating system, whether it is available in your language, and whether it meets your security and privacy requirements. In addition to these more technical criteria, consider whether a tool fits with the way you work. Does it work well with other tools and platforms that you use? Do the people you collaborate with use the same tool for the same practice, or at least one that is compatible with the one you use? Also consider the learning curve: do you need to invest a lot of time into learning the new tool, and if so, is that worth it for you? Do you have support (either in real life or online) that can help you learn to use the tool? </p>
<p>Perhaps the best advice is to first consider what it is you would like to do: what is the open science practice you&#x2019;d like to implement? Then explore which tools/platforms are available, which ones the people in your community use, and why (ask around!). Then make your own decision. Don&#x2019;t be afraid to experiment and try out something new! </p>
<p>A final remark: many tools and platforms support open science practices without themselves being fully open. For example, many commonly used tools are not open source, even though they provide access to content (publications, data) that are open. You will have to follow your own judgement as to whether you will consider such tools and platforms or not. Another consideration is whether you can export all your data when you&#x2019;d want to switch to another tool, or whether they are locked in? And do you know what will happen to your data when the platform closes down or is sold to a(nother) company? </p>

<p>PF - 1  Mind and Concept Maps</p>
<p>The conceptualisation of higher complexity subject matter can benefit a lot from visualizing recently acquired knowledge or skills. A great deal of enthusiasm can be raised when simple open source tools are used, individual and collectively. The general name for this set of  techniques is idea and concept mapping. A relatively simple software like <a href="http://www.xmind.net/" target="_blank">X-Mind</a> is a good basis to start with. <img src="../Images/image_17.png" alt="image alt text"></p>
<p>Figure X An example of an idea map to represent content in a training course</p>
<p>Note: we might replace this by one made for Open Science or a related subject</p>
<p>Learner engagement raises sharply as learners understand the power of visualising ideas, connecting them in diagrams, comparing diagrams between learners in the same group, comparing different groups, comparing learners with instructor maps, etc.</p>
